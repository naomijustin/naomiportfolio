## Introduction
This portfolio is to both demonstrate my skills in Front End Development, UX/UI and Art via the projects laid within, along with the portfolio itself.

## Process
* I first found other portfolio sites for inspiration on how I would like to design mine

### Inspiration
* https://bepatrickdavid.com/
* https://www.stevenmengin.com/
* https://www.joaobairrada.com/
* https://www.catchfishandchips.com.au/

### Design
* I then mocked up a few different designs until I was satisfied with both the look and the feasibility of scope. These were created using Procreate on the iPad Pro 10.5".
